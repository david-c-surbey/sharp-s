With examples out of the way, you'd believe you can read your data and the database. 

But how can the Teachers and Shoppers still find when you've changed the data by keeping track of it? 

Traditional programming lets you find and change data too easily to say you can have the perfect situation if you and your additions, usages, and steps associated are alongside and not in the way. 

But how does a hand count of inventory not show a customer there is zero left... no situation is perfect. But the robots KNOW, easily the example you might have come up with, low inventory instead of zero and of the screen... my homework since they're both my Teachers at Grade time... my answers like a Shopper searched COULD really be read one way or another. 

How do we let computers like robots read without error is Programming.

Some traditional examples left...or, next page right/below?
