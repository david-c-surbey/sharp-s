<h3>Classes & Modeling</h3>

  I've found many ways to setup a database or program software that, for the you, an end-user, you'll find translated into symbols like the above, the easiest softwaring; where, if you're looking to <b>program</b> or try your hand at holding a new dataset together,<i>you'd be ahead</i>. 
  
  Most in this, traditional way, are likely going to try and show what and why and where, and what i might be able to lend may only be the <i>how</i> with examples to get started that match some why and where. 'Whats' aren't exactly less than the entire language broached by an author; 'what' each part of a language already has with examples and that language already available offline with a: full-base-level. Sharp#s should be considered like a shorthand. A quick-way.
  

  Why I'm trying anything here is a great way to understand what i hope is an entrance to web-servrr programming and some shorthand into databasing you'd say, won't structure a changeset <b>unique</b> until late in the overall. <br>
 Even beginners...

 Most computers can find, these days anyway, any record made. You don't HAVE to be where the record is most likely made to make a lookup of a record. Your computer can search a file from any other folder or directory; but back in the day, you would be at a desk typing out the record and taking a piece of paper to the database or file-cabinet, by hand, and if it wasn't a good record, each piece proper, it would/could get lost.
</p>

<p>

 The fact was, for computers to let someone make an entry, the impossible would come about. Every typist had a few examples of what they could provide, typed out for you, and it could sit in the database or filed into the cabinet, as it was paper, since it would match 'boss-given-examples.' Each typist could confirm they used a Model, or example, to proof ahead of time the record made for you. Compared twice by a 'classy-typist', where the Class they are rests assured as the 'boss-designated-double-checker', assures all the typing that day was by Model example; no matter whom was typing...
</p>
<p>

 Sounds plausible and possible today but the fundamentals had not been a gift; until the pieces of paper became digital, the arguments lead only where in setting up and whichever digital version might arrive into pre-planning. Everything else was held by fewer than a handful of people as they did the typing...
</p>
 
<p>
 How could you structure the argument around for every example to match with rules around? Where any requested typing, each model-example and classy-touch guaranteeing the record sits and is good, readable again?

  <i>With pictograph as the guessers lead-in, or to say 'symbols' like above, the hearts and diamonds or clubs you might assign as labels. A databasing example could include all your Spade files to be pair-matching, meaning, without the needed 2-of-spade-form, a pair match file for a user file is still incomplete.

The goal of sharp#s being: coded lookup for reporting is could anywhere add in the same engineering, a readable database. By industry standard: easy Extraction Translate and Load or Logistic then Transform. ETL's and ELT's are easy hours deeper...
<br>To me, they've put hours ahead by skipping the programmer's basics from school.
"Data, restful, should, and for grades, does rest restfully type-checked, at submission, for grades." To take a photo captures every piece at grade turn in and the number 5 was/is an example of where 5.5 being an example can break computers. 5.0 would be fine as it adds to the decimal places but not if anyone expected 5. Nevermind finding the fix for it...
Everything got saved with it, right
 wrong,
 or even yet. Then everyone has to go find it to change it.

Traditionally, Classes and Models have governed how data grades. At best, it fits the model or the class can find it; like a type of any model the class is responsible for the record, overall.

Another way said to bring the Model and let moved up examples
where, with Classes eventually agreeing, any programmer read it all correct and the additional

Sharp#s should be an easy way to learn to pattern your data that
ANY large scale database is
easily manageable.

To describe different databases, 
each rule set you could apply! 
When assigning each Ace of Diamonds,
the deck back can tell you:
production?
staging?
Each and any place you'd structure.
With commas for, between the symbols above, any Ace has rules
Diamond did/do too.
Type Checking is to Database Entries as the Nutrion Label is to Pantry Sold Goods; everything to regular description, right now, with rules applying exactly what was
ever needed there for it to count.
<i>With grading</i> A-F, you'll
find your Chart of Account works great there. Extra rules around
The Diamonds? The-10's?
In a database: 'diamonds-9',
for phone numbers.

'--D9'    'dia-00111'  'üíé-nine'

For contacts?

'diamonds@9'

With panshift and drive database,
ones like with Domo.com and
Microsoft PowerBi, near
infinite databases in
column hold type,
databases that hold terabytes!
However, whatever sitting there.
All a nicely laid out set. With Sharp#s, you'd be able to read your records and find them quicker. 

Users don't <b> NEED </b> to read
so easily the unique strings.
But this strategy is about
prepping data so, why not
the way you store your
data, start a side
step and approach
overall? Real faster-query,
real faster-transforms in
any database environment.

Data around your data though... with a 52 ‚ô¶Ô∏è ‚ô†Ô∏è, Jack, 8-of-clubs and 4-of-culbs or 2‚ô¶Ô∏è being stronger than a 4‚ô¶Ô∏è in one deck...
not in another. Rules you
could use to store and say:
"The right, regular order."
And as large as you'd need... TRUE.
And as verbose as needed... TRUE...

As verbose as I've ever needed;<br>
