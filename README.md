Traditionally, Classes and Models have governed how data grades. At best, it fits the model or the class can find it; like a type of any model the class is responsible for the record, overall.

Another way said to bring the Model and let moved up examples
where, with Classes eventually agreeing, any programmer read it all correct and the additional

Sharp#s should be an easy way to learn to pattern your data that
ANY large scale database is
easily manageable.

===== ---- :::: &-+ && @-~

To describe different databases, 
each rule set you could apply! 
When assigning each Ace of Diamonds,
the deck back can tell you:
production?
staging?
Each and any place you'd structure.
With commas for, between the symbols above, any Ace has rules
Diamond did/do too.
Type Checking is to Database Entries as the Nutrion Label is to Pantry Sold Goods; everything to regular description, right now, with rules applying exactly what was
ever needed there for it to count.
<i>With grading</i> A-F, you'll
find your Chart of Account works great there. Extra rules around
The Diamonds? The-10's?
In a database: 'diamonds-9',
for phone numbers.

'--D9'    'dia-00111'  'üíé-nine'

For contacts?

'diamonds@9'

With panshift and drive database,
ones like with Domo.com and
Microsoft PowerBi, near
infinite databases in
column hold type,
databases that hold terabytes!
However, whatever sitting there.
All a nicely laid out set. With Sharp#s, you'd be able to read your records and find them quicker. 

Users don't <b> NEED </b> to read
so easily the unique strings.
But this strategy is about
prepping data so, why not
the way you store your
data, start a side
step and approach
overall? Real faster-query,
real faster-transforms in
any database environment.

Data around your data though... with a 52 ‚ô¶Ô∏è ‚ô†Ô∏è, Jack, 8-of-clubs and 4-of-culbs or 2‚ô¶Ô∏è being stronger than a 4‚ô¶Ô∏è in one deck...
not in another. Rules you
could use to store and say:
"The right, regular order."
And as large as you'd need... TRUE.
And as verbose as needed... TRUE...

As verbose as I've ever needed;<br>

be fun to share. But, the<br>

is harder to believe.<br>
R#138‚ô¶Ô∏è isn't a <br>
"real card", but it<br>
is an early made cards. <br>
