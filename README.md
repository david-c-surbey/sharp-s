<p>
  For transactional databasing; Language to propose the following: "Class Model in Assembly vi: Deck(s) of Card(s) saved directly into Real-Time-Web-Program."
</p>

<p>
  Take any standard card deck,<br>
fifty-two-(52) is easily<br>
imaginable. Dedicating the:<br>
deck-back, first, last?<br>
That's up to you...
</p>

The suites are most important.<br>
Traditionally, the 4:<br>
Spades<br>
Diamonds<br>
Clubs<br>
and lastly Hearts.<br>

Sharp#s should be an easy way to learn to pattern your data that
ANY large scale database is
easily manageable.



To describe different databases, 
each rule set you could apply! 
When assigning each Ace of Diamonds,
the deck back can tell you:
production?
staging?
Each and any place you'd structure.

With panshift and drive database,
ones like with Domo.com and
Microsoft PowerBi, near
infinite databases in
column hold type,
databases that hold terabytes!
However, whatever sitting there.
All a nicely laid out set.

Data around your data though... with a 52 ♦️ ♠️, Jack, 8-of-clubs and 4-of-culbs or 2♦️ being stronger than a 4♦️ in one deck...
not in another. Rules you
could use to store and say:
"The right, regular order."
And as large as you'd need... TRUE.
And as verbose as needed... TRUE...
AND free to learn here.
